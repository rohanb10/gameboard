#gameboard

C++
-------------

This repository contains several files which make a game board base class which has two derived game classes:

 - Tic Tac Toe
 - Gomoku

To play these games, download the files and build them as a Win32 Console Application. Run the executable file in command prompt with one of the following usage commands:

    game.exe TicTacToe
    game.exe Gomoku
    game.exe Gomoku 19 5
    
Tic Tac Toe is setup to be a 3x3 game board with 3 pieces to win.

Gomoku is setup to be a 19x19 board with 5 pieces to win by default. You can change this by adding two extra parameters to the usage command.

This game was built with [Fede Rozenberg](https://github.com/frozenberg) and Mike Heavner.
